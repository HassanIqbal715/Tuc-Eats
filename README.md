# Tuc Eats
Course project for Database Management Systems.

## Description
Tuc Eats is a web-based food-delivery application inspired from Food Panda and Uber Eats. The app provides students and restaurant owners (specifically at my university) with a platform to view, manage and order items accross the university.

## Issue Addressed
Lunch time and exams are rush hours for all the restaurants at the university. It is hard for them to keep up with all the orders, given that they have a very limited staff. For students as well, multiple phone calls ringing on the same number causes call flooding, and orders take longer to take and deliver. Consequently, food sometimes gets wasted due to delayed deliveries and a strict lunch schedule.

## Proposed Solution
An application that provides a bridge between students and restaurants. 

## Powered By
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JS.

Back-end: Node.js, Express.js.

Database: PostgreSQL.

## Key Features
The application provides an interface for both users and restaurant owners.

## Note
